# Python True Block Weight

## Installation

```sh
pip3 install https://github.com/faustbrian/ARK-Python-Client/archive/master.zip
pip3 install psycopg2
git clone https://github.com/galperins4/tbw
cd ~/tbw
npm install
```

## Configuration & Usage

After the repository has been cloned you need to open the `config.json` and change it to your liking. Once this has been done execute `python3 tbw.py` to start true block weight script.

Alternatively I have also included an apps.json file if you want to run tbw via PM2 (need to install PM2 first and then pm2 start apps.json)

Important! - pay_addresses and keep keys should match in config.json. DO NOT delete the reserve key as it is required. All other's can be deleted or more added

As the script leverages @FaustBrians ARK python client as well as database retreival and storage classes, python 3.6+ is required. In addition it is  now required to run this alongside an ark/kapu reiay node given the DB interaction and little reliance on the API.

## Available Configuration Options
- network: which network you want to run true block weight for
- delegate IP: this serves as a back-up IP for the API to call to in case the localhost does not respond
- dbusername: this is the postgresql database username nodeDB
- publicKey: delegate public key
- interval:  the interval you want to pay voters in blocks. A setting of 211 would pay ever 211 blocks (or 422 ark)
- voter_share: percentage to share with voters (0.xx format)
- passphrase: delegate passphrase
- secondphrase: delegate second passphrase
- cover_tx_fees: Use this to indicate if you want to cover transaction fees (Y) or not (N)
- vote_cap: Use this if you cap voters for how much they can earn with votes. For example 10000 will mean any wallet over 10K will only be paid based on 10K weight
- blacklist: Options are block or assign. Block zero's out blocked accounts which then distributes their earnings to voters. Assign does the same but assigns weight to a designated account. 
- blacklist_addr: comma seperated list of addresses to block from voter payments
- blacklist_assign: if assign option is picked, this is the address those blacklisted shares go to. DO NOT SET to an account voting for said delegate. It is HIGHLY recommended this is set to the reserve address!
- fixed_deal: use this if you have a fixed deal with a voter (e.g., 45 ark per day).
- fixed_deal_amt: format is address:amount. The amount to pay should correspond to interval. 
- min_payment: Minimum threshold for payment. If set to 1, any payout less than 1 ARK will be held until the next pay run and accumulate
- reach: how many peers to broadcast payments to (Recommended - 20)
- keep: there are the percentages for delegates to keep and distrubute among x accounts (Note: reserve is required! all others are optional)
- pay_addresses: these are the addresses to go with the keep percentages (Note: reserve is required! all others are optional)
